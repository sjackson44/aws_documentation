###S3 Bucket:
	* Click create bucket, select a region.
	* Add a bucket policy to restrict user-client access.
	* Add a CORS policy to allow cross origin resource sharing between the client application and the server.
		- Bucket policies can be added by clicking on the magnifying glass next to the bucket name, clicking on permissions, clicking on 'Add bucket policy' and in the bottom left hand corner clicking on the AWS Policy Generator.
		- CORS configs can be made by clicking on the magnifiying glass next to the bucket name, clicking on 'Add CORS Configuration' and selecting 'Sample CORS Configurations' from the bottom left hand corner. Copy one of the examples and modify from there.
		- Most Firstborn projects will require that the s3 bucket have static website hosting enabled, click on the magnify glass near your s3 bucket on the left, go to 'Static Website Hosting' click 'Enable website hosting' and in the 'Index Document' portion type 'index.html' this will make it so that index.html is the default document to look for.
	* Review your changes and click the 'Save' button.
